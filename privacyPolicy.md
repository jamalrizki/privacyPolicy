# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy applies to the Zest Cocktails app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Jamal Rizki (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".

## Information Collection and Use

The Application itself does not intentionally collect personal information. However, some basic information may be automatically collected by the platform services (Apple App Store and Google Play Services) to enable core functionality and app store features. This may include:

- Basic device information for app functionality
- App store standard analytics
- Crash reports

The Application does not:
- Collect precise location information
- Collect personally identifiable information
- Use data for marketing purposes
- Share data with third parties beyond platform services

## Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)

For users in the European Union, any minimal data processing that occurs through platform services is based on the following legal grounds under GDPR:
- Legitimate interests: To maintain app functionality and security
- Contract: To provide you with the app service you requested
- Legal obligation: To comply with applicable laws

## Your Rights Under GDPR

If you are in the European Union, you have the following rights:
- Right to access any data processed through the Application
- Right to correction of inaccurate data
- Right to erasure of your data ("right to be forgotten")
- Right to restrict processing
- Right to data portability
- Right to object to processing
- Right to withdraw consent

To exercise these rights, please contact contact@jrizki.com. While the Application does not directly collect personal data, we will assist you with any platform-related data requests.

## Third Party Services

The Application utilizes standard platform services that have their own Privacy Policy about handling data:
- Apple App Store Services
- Google Play Services

## Data Transfers

While the Application itself does not transfer data, platform services may process data outside the EU/EEA. Such transfers are covered by the platform providers' respective data protection mechanisms.

## Data Protection Officer

Given the minimal data processing nature of the Application, we have not appointed a Data Protection Officer. For any privacy-related queries, please contact: contact@jrizki.com

## Data Retention

Since the Application does not collect user data directly, there is no user data retained by the Service Provider. Any data automatically collected by platform services follows their respective retention policies.

## Children

The Application does not address anyone under the age of 13. The Service Provider does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided any information through the Application, please contact the Service Provider at contact@jrizki.com.

## Security

While the Application does not collect personal data, the Service Provider maintains appropriate technical measures to protect any interaction with the Application and platform services.

## Changes

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. The Service Provider will notify users of any changes by updating this page. Users are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

This privacy policy is effective as of 2024-12-05

## Contact Us
